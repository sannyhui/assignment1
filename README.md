# HKUSPACE Kotlin assignment 1 - Mini Card Game

### This is my first Kotlin app. Logic for the app was simple but I was fascinated on how to deal with the XML GUI interface. I spent many weeks searching methods to swap pages, animation, list view, etc which were not taught in the class. After collecting those coding, it was a challenge to implement them into my own project. I was lucky that those components were added perfectly. I was speculating to learn more knowledge on mobile development after this assignment was completed.
